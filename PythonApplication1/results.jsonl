{"prompt": "Could you construct an SVG markup that portrays a complex marine ecosystem, integrating a three-dimensional illusion, and a phosphorescent reflection effect for the aquatic organisms? The organisms should display behaviors such as darting, rotating, and modulating their depth in a probabilistic manner, and then proceed to swim. The animation should mirror reality, taking into account factors like aquatic currents, gravitational pull, marine biodiversity, and obstructions in the habitat such as corals and aquatic plants.\n\nThe marine organisms should transition their pigmentation from cerulean to emerald and then to violet as they swim, simulating the effect of sunlight penetrating through the water surface. The color transition should be gradual and lifelike. The reflections of the organisms should also modify in accordance with the position of a simulated moving light source.\n\nIncorporate a current effect that influences the swimming trajectory of the organisms. The current should be represented as a variable force, causing the organisms to sway left and right, and up and down as they swim. The strength, direction, and depth of the current should fluctuate over time, and this should be reflected in the organisms' movement.\n\nThe SVG markup should be optimized for performance and should function across all contemporary web browsers. Provide a piece of erroneous code that attempts to create the SVG markup and animation. Identify and rectify the errors in the code, and elucidate why the original code was incorrect.\n\nThe organisms should also turn and modulate their depth as they swim, with the turn speed, direction, and depth change being random over time to simulate the effect of water turbulence. The turn and depth change should also affect the position and intensity of the reflection.\n\nThe SVG markup should also include a background scene of a detailed coral reef ecosystem, including a variety of corals, aquatic plants, and a shining sun, and the organisms should swim across this environment. The environment should also be affected by the changing light source and current, with their reflections and shapes altering accordingly.\n\nThe organisms should vanish when they reach a certain distance, with the tail disappearing last. The disappearing should be realistic, with the inside of the coral and aquatic plants revealed. The organisms should also persist in changing color and casting reflections in accordance with the light source.\n\nThe second, third, fourth, and fifth organisms should swim a few seconds after the first one, each following a different path and affected by different current conditions. The organisms should interact with each other and the environment if they come into contact while swimming or after disappearing.\n\nThe SVG markup and animation should be created using only JavaScript and SVG, without any external libraries or tools. The code should be well-commented and easy to comprehend, and should adhere to best practices for performance and readability.\n\nIn addition, the code should also include a user interface that allows users to control the speed, direction, and color of the organisms, as well as the intensity and direction of the current. The user interface should be intuitive and easy to use, and should also be created using only JavaScript and SVG.\n\nFurthermore, the user interface should allow users to add or remove organisms mid-animation, and the code should dynamically adjust the animation and interactions accordingly. The organisms should also emit a trail as they swim, with the trail's color and intensity changing in accordance with the organisms' color and speed.\n\nMoreover, the user interface should allow users to control the time of day, altering the lighting conditions and color palette of the scene. The organisms should also respond to user input, altering their swimming patterns and behaviors in real-time. The user interface should also allow users to add or remove obstacles in the environment, and the organisms should dynamically adjust their swimming patterns to evade these obstacles.\n\nAdditionally, the SVG markup should include a predator shark that follows the school of organisms, with its speed and direction influenced by the movement of the school. The predator shark should also react to the user's input, altering its hunting patterns and behaviors in real-time.\n\nTo increase the difficulty, the SVG markup should also include a simulation of the food chain, with smaller organisms being eaten by larger organisms. The organisms should exhibit realistic behaviors when hunting or being hunted, such as fear, aggression, and evasion. The code should also simulate the life cycle of the organisms, with organisms growing larger over time, reproducing, and eventually dying. The user interface should allow users to control the population size, growth rate, and lifespan of the organisms. The code should also include a simulation of the ecosystem, with the health of the environment affecting the health and behavior of the organisms.\n\nTo further increase the difficulty, the SVG markup should also include a simulation of the effects of different types of underwater sounds on the behavior of the organisms. The code should simulate the effects of sounds produced by other marine animals, human activities, and natural phenomena on the organisms, with the organisms exhibiting realistic behaviors such as fear, curiosity, and aggression in response to these sounds. The user interface should allow users to control the type and intensity of the sounds, and the code should dynamically adjust the behavior of the organisms in response to changes in sound. The code should also include a simulation of the effects of different types of light on the behavior of the organisms, with the organisms exhibiting realistic behaviors such as attraction, repulsion, and confusion in response to different colors and intensities of light. The user interface should allow users to control the color and intensity of the light, and the code should dynamically adjust the behavior of the organisms in response to changes in light.\n\nTo further increase the difficulty, the SVG markup should also include a simulation of the effects of different types of water conditions on the behavior of the organisms. The code should simulate the effects of water conditions such as temperature, salinity, and pH on the organisms, with the organisms exhibiting realistic behaviors such as seeking shelter, slowing down, or becoming more active in response to these conditions. The user interface should allow users to control the type and intensity of the water conditions, and the code should dynamically adjust the behavior of the organisms in response to changes in water conditions. The code should also include a simulation of the effects of different types of pollutants on the behavior of the organisms, with the organisms exhibiting realistic behaviors such as sickness, decreased activity, and death in response to these pollutants. The user interface should allow users to control the type and intensity of the pollutants, and the code should dynamically adjust the behavior of the organisms in response to changes in pollution. The code should also include a simulation of the effects of different types of conservation efforts on the behavior of the organisms, with the organisms exhibiting realistic behaviors such as increased health and activity in response to these efforts. The user interface should allow users to control the type and intensity of the conservation efforts, and the code should dynamically adjust the behavior of the organisms in response to changes in conservation efforts.\n\nTo further increase the difficulty, the SVG markup should also include a simulation of the effects of different types of water conditions on the behavior of the organisms.

The registration process should collect the user's name, email, and age, and store this information securely in a database.\n\nAfter the user has successfully registered and logged in, they should be able to make a GET request to the API endpoint you created, providing their username as a parameter. Your endpoint should validate the user's credentials and check if the username exists in the database. If it does, the endpoint should make a request to the external API using the API key to retrieve the user's information. The retrieved information should then be returned as a response to the user.\n\nAdditionally, you should implement a functionality that keeps track of the user's recent activities.

Implement error handling for scenarios such as invalid API key, invalid username, and failed requests to the external API.

Generate an authentication token for a user when they successfully log in, and set an expiration time for the token (e.g., 1 hour). Users should include the token in their API requests for authentication, and the endpoint should validate the token and reject expired tokens.\n\n6. Implement role-based access control. Create different user roles (e.g., admin, regular user) and restrict access to certain API endpoints based on these roles. Only admin users should have access to endpoints for managing users or modifying user information.\n\n7. Implement user input validation and sanitization.
